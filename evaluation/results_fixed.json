Training these models requires vast GPU clusters and significant computing time, posing major challenges in terms of scalability, efficiency, and reliability. This survey explores recent advancements in training systems for LLMs, including innovations in training infrastructure with AI accelerators, networking, storage, and scheduling. Additionally, the survey covers parallelism strategies, as well as optimizations for computation, communication, and memory in distributed LLM training. It also includes approaches of maintaining system reliability over extended training periods. By examining current innovations and future directions, this survey aims to provide valuable insights towards improving LLM training systems and tackling ongoing challenges. Furthermore, traditional digital circuit-based computing systems face significant constraints in meeting the computational demands of LLMs, highlighting the need for innovative solutions such as optical computing and optical networks.\nSubjects: |  Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)\n---|---\nCite as: | [arXiv:2407.20018](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20018) [cs.DC]\n| (or  [arXiv:2407.20018v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20018v1...\n[Content truncated]\n\n\n================================================================================\nResult 2: Training large language models more efficiently -

These models are great at understanding, generating, and translating human language. But as these models get bigger, they demand more computing power and memory, making their training challenging. Finding ways to train these models efficiently is now a top priority. This article will explore different strategies for training large language models, especially focusing on two methods: [Fully Sharded Data Parallel](/en/keywords/fully-sharded-data-parallel--k37e2wd) ([FSDP](/en/keywords/fully-sharded-data-parallel--k37e2wd)) and Distributed Data Parallel ([DDP](/en/keywords/ddp--k9vq561)).\n### #The Challenges of Training Large Language Models\nLarge language models, often referred to as LLMs, have surged in popularity due to their advanced capabilities. However, training these large models is not easy. They require significant computational resources and memory, which can lead to long training times and high costs. Traditional methods of training, such as using a single GPU, may not be enough for these complex models.\nAs a result, exciting new techniques are being developed to help distribute the workload across multiple GPUs. This allows researchers to manage the computational demands better and enhance the efficiency of the training process.\n### #What Are Parallel Training Strategies?\nParallel training strategies refer to methods used in machine learning to distribute the workload of training a model across multiple processing units, like GPUs. There are two main types: [Data Parallelism](/en/keywords/data-parallelism--k3l6vz2) and [Model Parallelism](/en/keywords/model-parallelism--kk6q8pr).\n#### #Data Parallelism\nIn data parallelism, the same model is replicated across different GPUs. Each GPU works on a different subset of the data. Once they have processed the data, the results are synchronized so that the model is updated consistently.\n#### #Model Parallelism\nModel parallelism is used when a model is too large to fit on a single GPU. In this approach, different parts or layers of the model are placed on different GPUs. This allows for larger models to be trained, but it also introduces additi...\n[Content truncated]\n",

These models are great at understanding, generating, and translating human language. But as these models get bigger, they demand more computing power and memory, making their training challenging. Finding ways to train these models efficiently is now a top priority. This article will explore different strategies for training large language models, especially focusing on two methods: [Fully Sharded Data Parallel](/en/keywords/fully-sharded-data-parallel--k37e2wd) ([FSDP](/en/keywords/fully-sharded-data-parallel--k37e2wd)) and Distributed Data Parallel ([DDP](/en/keywords/ddp--k9vq561)).\n### #The Challenges of Training Large Language Models\nLarge language models, often referred to as LLMs, have surged in popularity due to their advanced capabilities. However, training these large models is not easy. They require significant computational resources and memory, which can lead to long training times and high costs. Traditional methods of training, such as using a single GPU, may not be enough for these complex models.\nAs a result, exciting new techniques are being developed to help distribute the workload across multiple GPUs. This allows researchers to manage the computational demands better and enhance the efficiency of the training process.\n### #What Are Parallel Training Strategies?\nParallel training strategies refer to methods used in machine learning to distribute the workload of training a model across multiple processing units, like GPUs. There are two main types: [Data Parallelism](/en/keywords/data-parallelism--k3l6vz2) and [Model Parallelism](/en/keywords/model-parallelism--kk6q8pr).\n#### #Data Parallelism\nIn data parallelism, the same model is replicated across different GPUs. Each GPU works on a different subset of the data. Once they have processed the data, the results are synchronized so that the model is updated consistently.\n#### #Model Parallelism\nModel parallelism is used when a model is too large to fit on a single GPU. In this approach, different parts or layers of the model are placed on different GPUs. This allows for larger models to be trained, but it also introduces additi...\n[Content truncated]\n",

These models are great at understanding, generating, and translating human language. But as these models get bigger, they demand more computing power and memory, making their training challenging. Finding ways to train these models efficiently is now a top priority. This article will explore different strategies for training large language models, especially focusing on two methods: [Fully Sharded Data Parallel](/en/keywords/fully-sharded-data-parallel--k37e2wd) ([FSDP](/en/keywords/fully-sharded-data-parallel--k37e2wd)) and Distributed Data Parallel ([DDP](/en/keywords/ddp--k9vq561)).\n### #The Challenges of Training Large Language Models\nLarge language models, often referred to as LLMs, have surged in popularity due to their advanced capabilities. However, training these large models is not easy. They require significant computational resources and memory, which can lead to long training times and high costs. Traditional methods of training, such as using a single GPU, may not be enough for these complex models.\nAs a result, exciting new techniques are being developed to help distribute the workload across multiple GPUs. This allows researchers to manage the computational demands better and enhance the efficiency of the training process.\n### #What Are Parallel Training Strategies?\nParallel training strategies refer to methods used in machine learning to distribute the workload of training a model across multiple processing units, like GPUs. There are two main types: [Data Parallelism](/en/keywords/data-parallelism--k3l6vz2) and [Model Parallelism](/en/keywords/model-parallelism--kk6q8pr).\n#### #Data Parallelism\nIn data parallelism, the same model is replicated across different GPUs. Each GPU works on a different subset of the data. Once they have processed the data, the results are synchronized so that the model is updated consistently.\n#### #Model Parallelism\nModel parallelism is used when a model is too large to fit on a single GPU. In this approach, different parts or layers of the model are placed on different GPUs. This allows for larger models to be trained, but it also introduces additi...\n[Content truncated]\n",

Here are a few key points from the search results:\n\n1. **Using `await` in the wrong kind of loop**: Beginners may use `forEach` or `map` with `await` incorrectly, causing requests to run sequentially instead of in parallel. The fix involves using `Promise.all` for parallel execution.\n2. **Swallowing errors**: Relying on implicit promise errors or not propagating context can lead to unhandled rejections. It's recommended to return a Result type or rethrow errors with context for better error handling.\n3. **Ignoring cancellation and timeouts**: Beginners may start async work without proper cancellation mechanisms, leading to wasted resources and potential UI issues. Implementing cancellation logic is crucial to prevent such issues.\n\nIf you'd like more detailed information or additional tips, feel free to let me know!",

Below are five mistakes I see most often in JavaScript/TypeScript, with broken code, the fix, and why the fix is better.\n## `1. await` in the wrong kind of loop (or serial work that could be parallel)\n**The mistake (JS/TS):** Using `forEach`/`map` with `await` incorrectly, or doing requests **one-by-one** when they could run **in parallel**.\nconst ids = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nids.forEach(async (id) => {\nconst user = await api.getUser(id); // not awaited by forEach\nconsole.log(user.name);\n});\n**What goes wrong?**\n* `Array.forEach` doesn’t await the inner async function → the outer function returns before work finishes.\n* Even with a `for..of` \\+ `await`, you may run requests **sequentially** when they could run faster in **parallel**.\nHere is how to fix\nconst users = await Promise.all(ids.map((id) => api.getUser(id)));\nusers.forEach(u => console.log(u.name));\n**Why this is optimal?**\n* `Promise.all` fires requests **together** , reducing total latency.\n* You still get a single await point for error handling.\n## 2\\. Swallowing errors (or letting them explode as unhandled rejections)\n**The mistake (JS/TS):** Relying on implicit promise errors, or using `catch` but not _propagating_ context.\nasync function loadProfile(id: number) {\ntry {\nreturn await api.getProfile(id);\n} catch (e) {\nconsole.error('Failed'); // swallowed\n}\n}\n**What goes wrong?**\n* Callers can’t react (retry, fallback, show message) because the function resolves to `undefined` on failure.\n* Unhandled rejections crash processes or trigger noisy logs later.\nTo fix this let’s return a Result or rethrow with context:\n**Option 1** : Rethrow with context\nasync function loadProfile(id: number) {\ntry {\nreturn await api.getProfile(id);\n} catch (e) {\nthrow new Error(`loadProfile(${id}) failed: ${(e as Error).message}`);\n}\n}\n**Option 2:** Explicit Result type\ntype Result<T> = { ok: true; data: T } | { ok: false; error: Error };\nasync function loadProfileSafe(id: number): Promise<Result<Profile>> {\ntry {\nconst data = await api.getProfile(id);\nreturn { ok: true, data };\n} catch (e) {\nreturn { ok: false, error: e as Error };\n}\n}\nThis is optimal because the callers can reliably handle failures, and you preserve **context** —crucial for debugging production issues.\n## 3\\. Ignoring cancellation and timeouts\n**The mistake:** Starting async work but never cancelling it (user navigates away, request becomes stale), or allowing calls to hang indefinitely.\n**What goes wrong?**\n* Wasted bandwidth and battery.\n* Stale responses race back and overwrite fresh UI.\n* Threads/dispatchers remain busy → UI jank.\n**To fix this use`AbortContro...\n[Content truncated]\n\n\n================================================================================\nResult 3: 7 Common Mistakes That Beginners Should Avoid While Learning to Code\nURL: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/7-common-mistakes-that-beginners-should-avoid-while-learning-to-code/\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nContent:\n__\n* [DSA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/dsa-tutorial-learn-data-structures-and-algorithms/)\n* [Practice Problems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore)\n* [C ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c/c-programming-language/)\n* [C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/c-plus-plus/)\n* [Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/java/)\n* [Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-programming-language-tutorial/)\n* [JavaScript](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/javascript-tutorial/)\n* [Data Science](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-science/data-science-for-beginners/)\n* [Machine Learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/machine-learning/)\n* [Courses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/courses)\n* [Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/linux-tutorial/)\n* [DevOps](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/devops/devops-tutorial/)\n* [SQL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql/sql-tutorial/)\n* [Web Development](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-tech/web-technology/)\n* [System Design](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/system-design-tutorial/)\n* [Aptitude](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/aptitude/aptitude-questions-and-answers/)\n__\n__ __ __\nSign In\n▲\n[ Open In App ](https://geeksforgeeksapp.page.link/?link=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/7-common-mistakes-that-beginners-should-avoid-while-learning-to-code/?type%3Darticle%26id%3D438986&apn=free.programming.programming&isi=1641848816&ibi=org.geeksforgeeks.GeeksforGeeksDev&efr=1)\n# 7 Common Mistakes That Beginners Should Avoid While Learning to Code\nLast Updated :  15 Jul, 2025\n__\nComments\n__\nImprove\n__\n*   *   *\n__ Suggest changes\n21 Likes\n__ Like\n__ Report\n****Learning to code**** is intimidating for beginners.

[Report Abuse](/report-abuse)\nAsynchronous programming is a very important concept in JavaScript, through which tasks execute in a concurrent manner, making applications perform better and enhancing user experience. It does not work like synchronous programming, where tasks are executed one after the other. In order to run parallelly and perform better, `asynchronous programming` does not allow the code execution to wait for any time-consuming operations, be it the fetching of data from a server or reading files.\n##  The Basics of Asynchronous programming Execution\nIn this, functions are executed independently of the main program flow. It means, if one task is processing, the rest of the program can continue running and executing other tasks without waiting for `asynchronous operation` to finish. There are several ways in `JavaScript` to run program asynchronously:\n1. Callbacks\n2. Promises\n3. Async/ Await\n##  Callback\nCallbacks are one of the essential concepts for the asynchronous programming of JavaScript. Basically, a callback is a function that is passed as an `argument` to another function and is invoked or called later, after some operation has been completed. Callbacks find major use in cases where an operation will take some time to complete, for example, fetching data from a server or reading a file. Therefore , nesting of callback-based code to achieve control flow makes it hard to read and leads to phenomenon known as \"callback hell\".\nfunction fetchData(callback) {\nsetTimeout(() => {\ncallback(\"Data fetched successfully\");\n}, 2000);\n}\nfetchData((data) => {\nconsole.log(data);\n});\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nData fetched successfully\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nThe `fetchData` function simulates an asynchronous operation using setTimeout. When the operation completes, it invokes the callback function passed to it with the fetched data.\n##  Promises\nIt was introduced in ES6 as a cleaner altern...\n[Content truncated]\n\n\n================================================================================\nResult 3: Practical Guide to Asynchronous Programming in Python\nURL: https://betterstack.com/community/guides/scaling-python/python-async-programming/\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nContent:\n[ Back to Scaling Python Applications guides ](/community/guides/scaling-python/)\n#  Practical Guide to Asynchronous Programming in Python\n[Python](/tag/python?utm_content&utm_medium=guides&utm_source=community&utm_term=python-async-programming)\nStanley Ulili\nUpdated on April 15, 2025\n###### Contents\n* Prerequisites\n* Step 1 — Understanding the basics of asynchronous programming\n* Step 2 — Your first async program with `asyncio`\n* Step 3 — Working with async generators and for loops\n* Step 4 — Managing many async tasks with semaphores\n* Final thoughts\n[Python](https://www.python.org/) gives you powerful tools for asynchronous programming. This lets you write concurrent code without dealing with the headaches of traditional threading.\nThe `asyncio` library, added in Python 3.4 and improved in later versions, offers a clean way to write single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, event loops, and Future objects.\nIn this guide, I'll show you how to create and use effective asynchronous patterns in your Python applications.\n[ The fastest log\nsearch on the planet  Better Stack lets you see inside any stack, debug any issue, and resolve any incident.

Create a file named `main.py` with this code:\nmain.py\nCopied!\nimport time\ndef fetch_data(source):\nprint(f\"Fetching data from {source}...\")\ntime.sleep(2)  # Simulating I/O operation\nprint(f\"Done fetching from {source}\")\nreturn f\"Data from {source}\"\ndef main():\nstart_time = time.time()\n# Sequential execution of three operations\ndata1 = fetch_data(\"source_1\")\ndata2 = fetch_data(\"source_2\")\ndata3 = fetch_data(\"source_3\")\nresults = [data1, data2, data3]\nend_time = time.time()\nprint(f\"Total execution time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds\")\nprint(f\"Results: {results}\")\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\nmain()\nIn this example, you fetch data from three sources using the `fetch_data` function, which has a 2-second delay to simulate I/O operations. The `main` function runs these tasks one after the other, so each one waits for the previous to finish before starting.\nThis means the total execution time is about 6 seconds (2 seconds per task). This shows the problem with blocking operations—each task delays the next. In the next step, you'll see how ...\n[Content truncated]\n",

[Report Abuse](/report-abuse)\nAsynchronous programming is a very important concept in JavaScript, through which tasks execute in a concurrent manner, making applications perform better and enhancing user experience. It does not work like synchronous programming, where tasks are executed one after the other. In order to run parallelly and perform better, `asynchronous programming` does not allow the code execution to wait for any time-consuming operations, be it the fetching of data from a server or reading files.\n##  The Basics of Asynchronous programming Execution\nIn this, functions are executed independently of the main program flow. It means, if one task is processing, the rest of the program can continue running and executing other tasks without waiting for `asynchronous operation` to finish. There are several ways in `JavaScript` to run program asynchronously:\n1. Callbacks\n2. Promises\n3. Async/ Await\n##  Callback\nCallbacks are one of the essential concepts for the asynchronous programming of JavaScript. Basically, a callback is a function that is passed as an `argument` to another function and is invoked or called later, after some operation has been completed. Callbacks find major use in cases where an operation will take some time to complete, for example, fetching data from a server or reading a file. Therefore , nesting of callback-based code to achieve control flow makes it hard to read and leads to phenomenon known as \"callback hell\".\nfunction fetchData(callback) {\nsetTimeout(() => {\ncallback(\"Data fetched successfully\");\n}, 2000);\n}\nfetchData((data) => {\nconsole.log(data);\n});\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nData fetched successfully\nEnter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode\nThe `fetchData` function simulates an asynchronous operation using setTimeout. When the operation completes, it invokes the callback function passed to it with the fetched data.\n##  Promises\nIt was introduced in ES6 as a cleaner altern...\n[Content truncated]\n\n\n================================================================================\nResult 3: Practical Guide to Asynchronous Programming in Python\nURL: https://betterstack.com/community/guides/scaling-python/python-async-programming/\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nContent:\n[ Back to Scaling Python Applications guides ](/community/guides/scaling-python/)\n#  Practical Guide to Asynchronous Programming in Python\n[Python](/tag/python?utm_content&utm_medium=guides&utm_source=community&utm_term=python-async-programming)\nStanley Ulili\nUpdated on April 15, 2025\n###### Contents\n* Prerequisites\n* Step 1 — Understanding the basics of asynchronous programming\n* Step 2 — Your first async program with `asyncio`\n* Step 3 — Working with async generators and for loops\n* Step 4 — Managing many async tasks with semaphores\n* Final thoughts\n[Python](https://www.python.org/) gives you powerful tools for asynchronous programming. This lets you write concurrent code without dealing with the headaches of traditional threading.\nThe `asyncio` library, added in Python 3.4 and improved in later versions, offers a clean way to write single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, event loops, and Future objects.\nIn this guide, I'll show you how to create and use effective asynchronous patterns in your Python applications.\n[ The fastest log\nsearch on the planet  Better Stack lets you see inside any stack, debug any issue, and resolve any incident.

Create a file named `main.py` with this code:\nmain.py\nCopied!\nimport time\ndef fetch_data(source):\nprint(f\"Fetching data from {source}...\")\ntime.sleep(2)  # Simulating I/O operation\nprint(f\"Done fetching from {source}\")\nreturn f\"Data from {source}\"\ndef main():\nstart_time = time.time()\n# Sequential execution of three operations\ndata1 = fetch_data(\"source_1\")\ndata2 = fetch_data(\"source_2\")\ndata3 = fetch_data(\"source_3\")\nresults = [data1, data2, data3]\nend_time = time.time()\nprint(f\"Total execution time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds\")\nprint(f\"Results: {results}\")\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\nmain()\nIn this example, you fetch data from three sources using the `fetch_data` function, which has a 2-second delay to simulate I/O operations. The `main` function runs these tasks one after the other, so each one waits for the previous to finish before starting.\nThis means the total execution time is about 6 seconds (2 seconds per task). This shows the problem with blocking operations—each task delays the next. In the next step, you'll see how ...\n[Content truncated]\n",
